# Connect-4

## What this Project is
This was an assignment for my introduction to artificial intelligence course. This assignment was assigned to assess our ability to implement the Minimax algorithm. We created a Connect4 AI that implemented the Minimax algorithm in a tree of our own making.

## Involved Parties
I created connect4player.py, however the connect4.py was created by the instructing professor, Dr. Adam A. Smith. This file was supplied to utilize our player file for testing purposes.

## References
The textbook for this class was "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.

## Instructions
connect4player.py does not have a main method, and therefore will not do anything when run. The file to run is connect4.py. To run, enter the number of players using -0, -1, or -2. To select the level of the AI, enter -l followed by a number indicating the level. To play the game in the command line rather than a new window, use -n.
